This is a simple JavaScript program to generate a dynamic wave animation on an HTML canvas. The animation creates the effect of turbulent ocean waves.

Usage

2. Create an HTML file and include the following content:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

  <style>
    body, html {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;

    canvas {
      display: block;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

Save the index.js file in the same directory as your HTML file.
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
